# Overview

Cantor's Diagonalization Argument contains assumptions that show the ignorance of the true concept of infinity. In resolution of that ignorance, a method to make  infinity properly understandable arises.

# Contents

This repository contains the text describing the flaws in the Argument and the Holey B.I.B.L.E method by which the nature of infinity can be understood without limitations, as well as providing code to generate tables that function as an accompaniment to the text.
