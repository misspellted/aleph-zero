In wathcing a few YouTube videos on the various perspectives on the idea of aleph, I've come to realize that most
people are not willing to properly address the shortcomings of Cantor's Diagonalization Argument. Not that they
incapable of sufficient inspection of the Argument; instead, they have demonstrated a mind capable of investigation
in the related areas. Maybe they are focusing on a larger topic that borrows ideas from or relies on the Argument,
maybe they assessed the Argument in a similar mindset and do not have the capacity to see the flaws in the
assumptions of the Argument, or some other perspectives that merely references the Argument in passing. No matter
the cause, the ideas expressed in this text and accompanying code serve to undermine the current comprehension and
restore the true concept of infinity, ridding humanity of the laziness that comes with just accepting the Argument
as the truth, and never truly questioning its assumptions.

[Cantor used binary, but we'll reuse decimal, which is what is presented in most YouTube videos. We'll be able to show
later that it won't matter what numerical base, or actually, any glyph-based system of notation, due to the properties
uncovered and discussed.]
